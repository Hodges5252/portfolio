  <p class="m-0 text-xl font-light">DisneyBot Ride Tracking App<p/>
  <p class="text-sm font-light">I am currently using SQL and PyTorch to train a machine learning model on years of Disneyland wait times combined with weather and seasonal trends. I hope to create a model that is able to predict upcoming wait times, and plan to integrate this into an app for parkgoers.<p/>
